# CSE-3320--Assignment-4-FAT32
In this fourth assignment for CSE3320 (Operating Systems) we familiarize ourselves with the FAT32 system. We will become familiar with the file allocation tables, endieness, as well as filea access. We will implement a user space shell application that is capable of interpreting a FAT32 file image system. The utility must not corrupt the file system image and should be robust. No existing kernel code or any other FAT32 utility code is used in our program. 

TODO: Some functionalities dont work fully (get for example)
